# Project 2 - Rust Microservice
The goal for this project will be to show how data transformations can be used to find relationships between variables. The first iteration of this project has functions to read in the data, apply log and square root transforms, and plot the data. The next step is to add the actix framework for the microservice. 
   
For the second iteration of the project, I added the actix mechanisms to interact with the microservice on the web page. The base page gives a welcome message, the log page computes the log transform and creates a plot, the sqrt page computes the square root transform and creates a plot, and the image page displays the plot.
